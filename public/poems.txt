1 Sit between a panther and a condor in the dark.

2 Like an old man wearing thick glasses. Stare at the body

3 Take off your shoes, dance backward out of a room,

4 Repeat this forever, slower each time.

5 Be a hand carving bruises out from apples.

6 Eat the wounded bits. 

7 Write a list of those love you most.

8 Fake laugh until you real laugh.

9 While eating a mandarin imagine a man 

10 Imagine tiny white flowers flying in through a broken window.

11 Now draw what you see.

12 Walk to the middle of a rickety bridge over feral water.

13 Imagine an opal canyon where a single cactus opens a yellow eye.

14 Without moving your body, travel to space. 

15 Not the kind with stars, but between two pillars.

16 Build a suit of memory. This can be an enormous forgiveness. Or water with you in it. 

17 Look at yourself in the mirror. Soft, soft as a room full of kindergartners saying: I missed you.

18 Access your whole self 

19 without the spur of terror.

20 Meditate to the sound of someone pushing one rock slowly over a field of rocks.

21 Move abruptly to another country forever. 

22 Try not to forget your language.

23 Walk into the frigid sea. 

24 Do not retreat when a family of seals draws near.

25 Handle a dead animal tenderly with bare hands. 

26 Do this until you hear it whisper.

27 Using a pen you find on the ground, draw a picture of yourself 40 years from now.

28 Every day write three handwritten notes that read, You are someone important. Fold the notes and leave them in unremarkable places across the city.

29 Write EVERYTHING IS POSSIBLE over and over in a lined notebook until there is no more space. 

30 Create more space.
